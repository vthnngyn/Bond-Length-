# Bond Length
The code takes an .xyz file or xyz coordinates for atoms of a molecules and calculates the bond length between each atom with an upper length limit of L. 

The average and the standard deviation of the bond lengths are calculated. 

The coordination number for an atom is calculated by counting the number of other atoms that atom has a bond length under L with. 

coords.xyz is a sample file for bl.py to use
