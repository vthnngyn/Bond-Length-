# Bond Length
The code takes an .xyz file or xyz coordinates of atomic coordinates and calculates the bond length (with the average and standard deviation) between each atom up to an inputted upper limit.  

The coordination number per each atom is calculated by counting the number of other atoms that atom has a counted bond length with. 

example.xyz is a sample input file.
